@AndyKHLiu diff is that #Warriors have Steph. for first time, I think more isolation at key possessions is more needed than ball movement.
Not only did Lebron loose the last 3 games to the Spurs last year but he had 2 superstars to help him and still got overused. #Warriors

Disappointed the #Warriors lost but happy to see David Lee contribute. He will make his presence known as the series goes on. #TheFinals
All I keep reading though. All season long is how overrated the #Warriors are. They've won 80 fucking games (AND COUNTING!!!) but=OVERRATED
#Warriors 91-96 #Cavs. Game 3. Cavs lead 2-1. LeBron James 40pts 12rebs 8asts 4stls 2blks Stephen Curry 27pts 6rebs 6asts 3stls 7/13 3FGs.
#NBAFinals decided on Thursday, right? #warriors win, they take 2 of next 3. #cavs win, no way @KingJames loses 3 straight
The #Warriors are pathetic, they can't beat a #Cavs team that doesn't have Kyrie &amp; http://t.co/mMDldaRwbB. I'd imagine they'd be down 3-0

I am shell-shocked....stunned. I really thought the #Warriors were tougher than this. Saw this team all year no indication they would cower
#Warriors cannot continue this amateurish pattern of getting off to a slow start and then scrambling to make a comeback attempt.
Don't overlook the #Warriors comeback... gives Steph's shot and rest of offense some confidence for rest of series #NBAFinals

Some great teams have been down 2-1 during this year's playoffs--including both the #Cavs &amp; the #Warriors. There's a lot more ball to come.
@ikastest Right. Game 4 must win for the #Warriors
#Warriors dug themselves into hole that was way too big to overcome. Also #Cavs played some solid defense to get ahead #NBAFinals
Coincidence that the #Warriors started to play well when David Lee checked in? 

Perhaps he is just what GS needs to counter TT and Mozgov.

@LILBTHEBASEDGOD ? U got something for lebron? 

#jaymohrsports
Wouldn't feel good about that W if I was Cavs after being up by 20. W's just need one in Cleveland to take back home court. 

#WARRIORS
#Warriors lost game 2 and 3 vs. Memphis as well. The hope has to be that Steph Curry and the offensive figured it out in a 36 point 4th.

I said #Warriors in 6, I stand by that #NBAFinals
Tough loss. #Warriors may have found something in that 4th quarter though. #NBAFinals
@warriors - You are hanging close playing crappie! Bring ya A Game Thursday and blow 'em out! #WARRIORS #NBAFinals
LeBron James says the shots Curry hit in the 4th quarter are the same ones he was missing the first 3 quarters. #NBAFinals #Warriors
Fascinating. #cavs take 2-1 lead, yet feels like #warriors got back in series. Oh, and @KingJames is supercalafragalisitcexpealidocious
Yea! Go #Cavs !!! Great finish!! Beat those #Warriors ! #ALLinCLE  #Cleveland #WARRIORSvCAVS
Congrats to the Cavs. I'm not feeling good about my #Warriors though. They struggled and looked like toddlers. They're not ready.
If you think about it, the #Warriors were 1 shot away from being down 3-0 in the #NBA Finals. Yikes.

It's over for the #Warriors..Great defensive game #cavs
I am only ok with this loss if 1) it's a wake up call to play hard all 4 quarters and 2) Stephs confidence is back. #Warriors
How was that #Cavs ball after the review? Either it's a foul &amp; you call it OR it's a no call &amp; #Warriors ball. Worst. @NBA #NBAFinals
It's all good you all get this one but the real #warriors  fans are not worried one bit. Dubs will win Thursday night

We will get the next one #Warriors
@DamonBruce Bottom line is you can't go down by 20 in the NBA Finals! #Warriors
Hey, at least Steph found his shot again. Watch out in Game 4! #DubNation #NBAFinals #Warriors #GSW
Man, the #Warriors are in trouble. They are getting beat by LBJ and Delly. Inexcusable.

you can't teach physicality, HEART and desire. only an idiot would blame Steve Kerr. the #warriors are naturally a softer, new-school team
RT @NUEMONEY: #Warriors need Curry to go off come Game4 #NBAFinals
Surprised by the #Warriors. Still not over, but looking good for Cleveland. #Cavs
Shiiiiiiet no lie the #Cavaliers WANTED that game BAD!!! The #Warriors showed up but they didnt play like they wanted it.. 2-1 #Cavs now!!
And they stole the posession from the #Warriors #GoldenState #RefSucks
Mark Jackson always talkin shiiii about the #Warriors
LeBron is incredible, but I still think #Warriors win this series. Miami was up 2-1 in 2011.
Good push warriors!
Positives for game 4
Good 4th quarter chef

Better all round performance in game 4 fellas!!

I'm still saying, #Pelicans beat #Warriors too if they got these calls.
So the warriors lost, but curry is BACK #warriors

Alright, Bron. You did better than I expected without Kyrie. But Steph finally woke, back to the original prediction of #Warriors in 6!!
That will be the #Cleveland #Cavaliers last win in the 2015 #NBAFinals. The #Warriors figured it out. #BayArea #48minutesofHell

RT @AlZeidenfeld: The #Warriors should stop just letting Lebron get 40. #Cavs
#Warriors too little to late.
#Warriors had a great 4th quarter but that doesn't make up for the awful 3rd quarter. Where was this level of game play earlier? #GSWvsCLE
Gave the game away since the beginning..#Warriors#NBAFinals
The #Warriors need to re-group and comeback on Thursday. #NBAFinals.
Well... #Warriors didn't deserve to win Game 3 either. At least they showed some positives towards the end. Can build on that. #NBAFinals
#Cavs Win! #Warriors Waited To Late To Start Making Buckets! Struggled All Game
Lebron has been here. The warriors have not, point blank. Period. #Cavs #Warriors #NBAFinals

Gotta win tomorrow guys!!! #Warriors
#CAVS beat #Warriors 96-91 to put them ahead 2-1 in the series. Game 4 @ #CLE Thursday at 9. #NBAFinals

Was this the football stance LeBron took to Curry? #Warriors https://t.co/LU7iruAj8T
Still think #Warriors win GM 4, and win the series. But two things are clear....
These refs are crazy.....it's still #Warriors tho
The #Warriors were down 2-1 to memohos before. Just sayin. It aint over till its over #NBAFinals
And the #Cavaliers took another win! 2-1 #Warriors
Let's just say that if Harrison showed up even a little, the #Warriors would have won.  Garbage.  No need to resign him.
things are about to get interesting #Warriors
The #Warriors cannot afford a slow start the #Cavs will come out aggressive yet again #Game4
Great game! #cavs survive 2 late runs by the #Warriors.  Warriors gotta play better in the 1st 3 quarters. Great series so far!  #TheFinals
Good game, the #Warriors of the 2nd half need to show up the next game! #NBAFinals We'll be back stronger! #DubNation
We've been in this position before, it's all good!! #warriors
